For a science student, engineering is such a mainstream career in India, either one does it by choice or by social pressure. For me, engineering was my personal choice as I was so inclined towards mathematics and curious to know how stuff around me actually works.<br>
I completed my engineering in late July 2017 and did my specialization in the Electrical and Electronics branch. But somehow in between college days, I found my interest in coding as it was in our curriculum once, after that I started practicing problems on my own. In the last year of college, I got an opportunity to do my training in Java which gave a sharp curve to my professional career.<br>
I struggled a lot in the beginning as the concepts were new but the curiosity began to increase side by side on how actually softwares were developed and how they made things easier for the outer world.<br><br>

Now I treat every real-time entity as an object only as taught by Object-Oriented Programming Language Java. Pfff...objects make life easier really!<br><br>

Java gave me a whole new experience in how real-time applications work but I still give a little credit to my Electrical and Electronics engineering as I now have good but a bit blurry knowledge of hardware too.<br><br> 

The IT industry after these few years has proved to be a good learning and productive platform providing a huge amount of opportunities and interesting projects to work with. I would anytime want anyone with any kind of background career to pursue computers if he or she has the inclination, mindset, or interest towards it. The IT industry is believed to be adaptive enough to provide learning and experience to people working in it. Like it’s said, “Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it” similarly all technophiles are welcomed to explore any kind of projects and with the right inspirations you go a long way.<br>
